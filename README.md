# kim-kardashian-online

Create a stylish and modern home page for Kim Kardashian's personal website with the following elements:

- A full-width hero section with a professional photo of Kim and a short tagline introduction. Use a serif font for an elegant look.
- A brief bio section below the hero with 2-3 sentences about Kim. 
- A section with links to Kim's Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok profiles, using icons for each.
- A navbar at the top with the site title and links to "Home", "About", "Projects", "Gallery", and "Contact" pages.
- A footer at the bottom with a copyright notice.

Use a black and white color scheme with pops of pale pink for an on-brand, sophisticated vibe. Choose images that showcase Kim's beauty and style.
